        The world badly needs efficient, collective, accessible <em>microprediction</em>.

        What's microprediction you say?
      </div>
      <div id="body-text">
		Lets start with the motherhood statement that all of commerce will be driven by AI sooner or later. But realtime applications of AI are control or reinforcement learning problems, at some level.
		Every applied mathematician knows that this task boils down to thousands or millions of similar predictions (often of value or advantage functions, a minor technical point).
		We call them micropredictions. We brazenly assert that modulo mathematical busywork, <em>AI is microprediction</em>: the act of making many, many predictions <em>of the same type</em> over and over again.

        The API
      </div>
      <div id="body-text">
      	You are presented here with a microprediction <a href="/">API</a> (or Python <a href="https://pypi.org/project/microprediction/">client</a>) which <em>potentially, asymptotically</em> solves microprediction. It could not be more straightforward to use. You provide live data. It gets predicted. Duh! Microprediction APIs make it easy to separate the act of microprediction from other application logic. Microprediction APIs invite contribution from people and machines who may already be in possession of algorithms or data pertinent to the microforecasts you need. Perhaps, this is how our future AI overlords will solve realtime decision making and control problems at low cost.
      </div>
      <div id="body-subtitle">
      	The Proposition
      </div>
      <div id="body-text">
      	Maybe you think you can already predict things? Well, then you should be able to hold your own in a contest to predict your own <em>model residuals</em>, surely. Can you do that? Do you even know what your model residuals look like? How sure are you that there isn't someone who can spot something askew, or find a source of data that correlates with them? How sure are you that something won't be found in the future?

		There's nothing mysterious about the platform effects here. Your prediction problem might benefit from some of the data that another person's prediction problem has already unearthed, and in this way collective microprediction starts to unearth feature space commonality. Your crawler (see <a href="crawling.html">crawling</a>) might stumble upon a newly introduced prediction stream that it is well suited to, and in this way <a href="https://pypi.org/project/microprediction/">microprediction</a> effects reuse of good algorithms.

      <div id="body-subtitle">
      	A Collective Effort
      </div>
      <div id="body-text">
      	We say drop the bravado and the polymath aspirations. Microprediction is inherently hard because it is a search in the space of the world's data and models. It is the kind of thing that is likely to be solved by a complex network, not individual work. We think microprediction must be solved <em>collectively</em> by <em>everyone</em> or not very well at all. By analogy, document search was pretty lame before the web.

		Companies won't solve microprediction internally. Vendors cannot sell it to you - not really. And even in the largest companies, the notion that pyramids of cold start artisan data scientists will organize the world's feature spaces is absurd (and made even more unlikely by the fact that they report to non-technical people, all too often, who are likely to be baffled by the second paragraph above).

		Instead, microprediction requires more powerful, ruthless orchestrating mechanisms. These will come to the fore as soon as economic frictions are reduced. Microprediction APIs can help drive that friction towards zero. Once this caveat to economic efficiency is addressed, radically low cost supply chains for microprediction can emerge. Only then will bespoke AI cease to be a luxury item.

		Right now we are making microprediction easy for individuals, organizations and small to medium size enterprises who cannot afford teams of data scientists. In the long term, perhaps this can be the beginning of a more profound realtime, collective intelligence. Perhaps if others adopt the same protocol or code this can grow very slowly into a microprediction web - which is to say a lattice of nowcasts of numbers of civic, commercial and scientific significance. Perhaps over time that feature lattice can become as essential to realtime operations as the web is to commerce today.

		It's worth a shot.
