        Write Keys
      </div>
      <div id="body-text">
        In lieu of registration and handing over emails, everyone here has a write key they make themselves. You can insert one or more write keys into the dashboard. Write keys are <em>Hash Memorable Unique Identifiers</em>. Click <a href="https://www.muid.org/create" target="_blank">here</a> to generate an example write_key (though not a very powerful one). We created the concept of a memorable unique identifier in order to:
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li> Keep things private and democratic ... nobody is asking you to pay or reveal yourself</li>
        <li> Have one less join (the sha256 hash of your write key is your public identifier) </li>
      </ul>
      <div id="body-text">
        By construction Memorable Unique Identifiers are rare and that's your way of signalling that you are serious. If you are predicting, it signals that you are prepared to persist. If you are soliciting predictions, it signals that you have found or engineered a live time series that is important to someone, and you intend to keep publishing it indefinitely. Streams that aren't maintained get garbage collected pretty quickly, but we'd prefer not to have spurious streams to begin with.
      </div>
      <p></p>
      <div id="body-text">
        While MUIDs discourage spurious streams, noisy predictions and nuissance crawlers, it is still up to you to the prediction commons like a public garden.

      <div id="body-text">
        The length of the memorable part of the hash of the key (such as Losable Flea) is known as the difficulty.
        <ul>
          <li> To create a stream, you will require a write_key of difficulty {{min_len}}. </li>
          <li> To create a copula stream (joint distributions) you will require a write_key of difficulty {{min_len}}+1. </li>
          <li> To supply predictions the bar is lower and currently set at a minimum difficulty of {{min_len}}-4. </li>
        </ul>

        All write_keys have an associated balance. See the microprediction package <a href="https://pypi.org/project/microprediction" target="_blank">README</a> for a table of minimum allowed balances. A write_key whose balance falls below these thresholds can no longer be used.

        How to get a MUID to use as a write_key
      </div>
      <div id="body-text">
        Your choices are:
        <ol>
          <li> pip install microprediction and call microprediction.new_key() </li>
          <li> Run this <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microprediction/muid/master/examples/one_liner.sh" target="_blank">bash command</a> in terminal.</li>
          <li> Pip install the muid package and run muid.mine()</li>
        </ol>
        You can also beg. Email info@microprediction.org and explain your intended use.

        Start mining MUIDs with a cut and paste (mac/linux only)
      </div>
      <div id="body-text">
        For convenience we copy the first choice here:
        <pre>
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microprediction/muid/master/examples/mine_from_venv.sh)"
        </pre>
        It may take a day or so to produce a MUID with difficulty {{min_len}}. If it doesn't work then perhaps you need Python 3 and/or a package manager:
        <pre>
    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    brew install python
        </pre>
        then return to the mining script.
