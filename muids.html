<h1>Why MUIDs?</h1>

You need a write_key to use the <a href="/">microprediction APIs</a> or python library.
We use <a href="https://www.muid.org">MUID.org</a> (stands for <em>Memorable Unique Identifiers</em>) as a source of write_keys that take some time to generate. There is an explanatory <a href="https://vimeo.com/397352413">video</a>.
<p>
MUID write keys are "heavy" and that's your way of signalling that you are serious. Hopefully you have found or engineered
a live time series that is important to someone, and you intend to keep publishing it indefinitely.
Streams that aren't maintained get garbage collected pretty quickly, but we'd prefer not to have spurious streams to begin with. We also require those submitting predictions to possess a MUID. This discourages the creation of a large number of noisy prediction algorithms.

<h2>Minimum key difficulty</h2>

The length of the memorable part of the hash of the key is known as the difficulty. See the <a href="https://vimeo.com/397352413">video</a>. To create
a stream (see <a href="/crowd.html">crowd</a>) you will require a write_key of difficulty {{min_len}}. To supply predictions the bar is lower and currently
set at a minimum difficulty of 8.

<h2>Bankruptcy</h2>

All write_keys have an associated balance. See the microprediction package <a href="https://pypi.org/project/microprediction">README</a> for a table of minimum allowed balances. A write_key
whose balance falls below these thresholds can no longer be used.

<h2>How to get a key</h2>

Your choices are
<ol>
    <li> Click <a href="https://www.muid.org/create">this link</a> to get a key of borderline difficulty 8.
    <li> Run this <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microprediction/muid/master/examples/one_liner.sh">bash command</a> in terminal.
    <li> Pip install the muid package and run muid.mine()
</ol>
For convenience we copy choice 2 here:
<pre>
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microprediction/muid/master/examples/mine_from_venv.sh)"
</pre>
It may take a day or so to produce a MUID with difficulty {{min_len}}. If it doesn't work then perhaps you need Python 3 and/or a package manager:
<pre>
    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    brew install python
</pre>
then return to the mining script.

<h2>How to validate a key</h2>

Use a URL like <a href="http://www.muid.org/validate/fb74baf628d43892020d803614f91f29">http://www.muid.org/validate/fb74baf628d43892020d803614f91f29"</a>
